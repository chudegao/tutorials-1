T5-Base Model for Summarization, Sentiment Classification, and Translation
==========================================================================

**Authors**: `Pendo Abbo <pabbo@fb.com>`__, `Joe Cummings <jrcummings@fb.com>`__

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-40

Overview
 --------

 This tutorial demonstrates how to use a pretrained T5 Model for summarization, sentiment classification, and
 translation tasks. We will demonstrate how to use the torchtext library to:

 1. Build a text preprocessing pipeline for a T5 model
 2. Instantiate a pretrained T5 model with base configuration
 3. Read in the CNNDM, IMDB, and Multi30k datasets and preprocess their texts in preparation for the model
 4. Perform text summarization, sentiment classification, and translation

 .. note::
    This tutorial requires PyTorch 2.0.0 or later.

######################################################################
 Data Transformation
 -------------------

 The T5 model does not work with raw text. Instead, it requires the text to be transformed into numerical form
 in order to perform training and inference. The following transformations are required for the T5 model:

 1. Tokenize text
 2. Convert tokens into (integer) IDs
 3. Truncate the sequences to a specified maximum length
 4. Add end-of-sequence (EOS) and padding token IDs

 T5 uses a ``SentencePiece`` model for text tokenization. Below, we use a pretrained ``SentencePiece`` model to build
 the text preprocessing pipeline using torchtext's T5Transform. Note that the transform supports both
 batched and non-batched text input (for example, one can either pass a single sentence or a list of sentences), however the T5 model expects the input to be batched.

Model Preparation
-----------------

torchtext provides SOTA pretrained models that can be used directly for NLP tasks or fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Below
we use the pretrained T5 model with standard base configuration to perform text summarization, sentiment classification, and
translation. For additional details on available pretrained models, see `the torchtext documentation <https://pytorch.org/text/main/models.html>`__

Using ``GenerationUtils``
-------------------------

We can use torchtext's ``GenerationUtils`` to produce an output sequence based on the input sequence provided. This calls on the
model's encoder and decoder, and iteratively expands the decoded sequences until the end-of-sequence token is generated
for all sequences in the batch. The ``generate`` method shown below uses greedy search to generate the sequences. Beam search and
other decoding strategies are also supported.

Datasets
--------
torchtext provides several standard NLP datasets. For a complete list, refer to the documentation
at https://pytorch.org/text/stable/datasets.html. These datasets are built using composable torchdata
datapipes and hence support standard flow-control and mapping/transformation using user defined
functions and transforms.

Below we demonstrate how to preprocess the CNNDM dataset to include the prefix necessary for the
model to identify the task it is performing. The CNNDM dataset has a train, validation, and test
split. Below we demo on the test split.

The T5 model uses the prefix "summarize" for text summarization. For more information on task
prefixes, please visit Appendix D of the `T5 Paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf>`__

.. note::
      Using datapipes is still currently subject to a few caveats. If you wish
      to extend this example to include shuffling, multi-processing, or
      distributed learning, please see :ref:`this note <datapipes_warnings>`
      for further instructions.

Alternately, we can also use batched API, for example, apply the prefix on the whole batch:

.. code-block::

  def batch_prefix(task, x):
   return {
       "article": [f'{task}: ' + y for y in x["article"]],
       "abstract": x["abstract"]
   }

  cnndm_dataloader = DataLoader(cnndm_datapipe, batch_size=None)

We can also load the IMDB dataset, which will be used to demonstrate sentiment classification using the T5 model.
This dataset has a train and test split. Below we demo on the test split.

The T5 model was trained on the SST2 dataset (also available in torchtext) for sentiment classification using the
prefix ``sst2 sentence``. Therefore, we will use this prefix to perform sentiment classification on the IMDB dataset.

Finally, we can also load the Multi30k dataset to demonstrate English to German translation using the T5 model.
This dataset has a train, validation, and test split. Below we demo on the test split.

The T5 model uses the prefix "translate English to German" for this task.

    Example 1:

    prediction: fossils belonging to species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' - were found in a 19th century collection . they were rediscovered when the official Loch Ness fan club president, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them . he saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature .

    target: Fossils of a creature bearing a striking similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection . It is thought the fossil was found in Cromarty and would have once lived in a freshwater lake between 542 million years ago to 251 million years ago . Researchers have revealed that Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' - lived on the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness .


    Example 2:

    prediction: arsenal drew 0-0 with liverpool at the emirates stadium on sunday . a goalless draw was the first time the blues have won the league since 1997 . but manager jose mourinho has hit back at the club, branding their 11-year wait for the title as 'boring' .

    target: Chelsea edged closer to the Premier League title after a 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Sunday . The Blues were criticised in some quarters for an over-defensive display . Jose Mourinho has shrugged off those claims and said that the real boredom was in Arsenal's 11-year-wait to win a league title of their own . He hailed the individual performance of his captain John Terry as the defender's 'best ever' in his career .


    Example 3:

    prediction: the pilot scheme will recruit 10 people with autism or Asperger syndrome . they will be based at Microsoft's Redmond offices in washington . if successful, the scheme could extend to more vacancies worldwide . the plans were announced by Mary Ellen Smith, corporate vice president of worldwide operations .

    target: The pilot scheme will initially recruit 10 people with autism . They will be based in the tech giant's Redmond offices in Washington . Microsoft is running the scheme with help from specialists Specialisterne . The plans were announced by Mary Ellen Smith, corporate vice president of worldwide operations, who herself has a 19-year-old autistic son .


    Example 4:

    prediction: a Washington, DC-based company called United Space Structures wants to create a new space station . their giant cylinder could apparently replace the ISS . it would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity . it would be 1,300ft (400 metres) long, cost £200 billion ($300 billion) and take 30 years to build . the final design would be 330ft (100 metres) in diameter and 1,310ft (400 metres) long .

    target: Washington, DC company United Space Structures wants to create a new space station . It rotates four times a minute to create artificial gravity - with the 'stem' and 'dome spinning in opposite directions . It would be 1,300ft (400 metres) long, cost £200 billion ($300 billion) and take 30 years to build . ‘We believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space,’ Bill Kemp from USS told MailOnline .


    Example 5:

    prediction: the unofficial 2012 paperback book was revealed by a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by four sexual-assault victims . she brought forward the songbook and she had filed an administrative complaint over the book in 2012 . the 130-page songbook contains 70 songs with titles including Pubic Hair, The Kotex Song and Bestiality .

    target: The 130-page songbook contains 70 songs with titles including Pubic Hair and The Kotex Song as well as Bestiality . One of them, The S&M Man, is set to tune of The Candy Man and graphically describes sexually mutilating women . Revealed in lawsuit filing by four sexual-assault victims who want to stop the practice of sexual assault allegations within the military being handled entirely within the command structure .

    Example 1:

    input_text: sst2 sentence: I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clichéd and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say "Gene Roddenberry's Earth..." otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So, kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.

    prediction: negative

    target: negative


    Example 2:

    input_text: sst2 sentence: Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This one features the usual car chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick style, shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun, and even terrorist style bombs. All of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before.<br /><br />The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but hardly profound. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s. All passably acted but again nothing special.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts. Very simplistic, but then you weren't expecting Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scene.<br /><br />Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.

    prediction: positive

    target: negative


    Example 3:

    input_text: sst2 sentence: its a totally average film with a few semi-alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning. the end scene with the flask backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not really worth watching again, bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality
